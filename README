mudlle: MUD Language for Little Extensions
------------------------------------------

This software is Copyright (C) 1993-2012 David Gay and Gustav Hållberg.

Installation
------------
To compile this software for 32-bit x86 on Linux or OS X, just type 'make'.

To compile for 64-bit x86 on Linux or OS X, type 'make ARCH=amd64".

Other 32-bit platforms could work as well, as long as: x86builtins.o
is removed from OBJS in Makefile, and options.h is edited
appropriately. Porting to 64-bit platforms will require changes to the
garbage collector (alloc.c) and the basic type layout (mvalues.h).

If you have the GNU gmp package installed, you can add -DUSE_GMP to the
CFLAGS in the Makefiles (or to options.h) to enable "big" (unlimited
precision) integers.

Quick Introduction
------------------

mudlle is a small language designed for writing extensions to MUME, an
online multi-user game. It is heavily inspired by Scheme. This
distribution contains a stand-alone interpreter and compiler that can
be used to experiment with the language. It is up to you to integrate
it with your favourite application if you wish to use it as an
extension language.

Once compiled, run mudlle and check that basic stuff works:
./mudlle
mudlle> 2+3
Result: 5
mudlle>

EOF (Ctrl-D), or evaluating quit() will exit the interpreter.

doc/mudlle-intro.doc and doc/mudlle-ref.doc contain a somewhat out of date
language introduction and reference. However, everything described in those
documents should still work.

A compiler is available for x86/linux. To load it, type:
  load("xc.mud")
at the 'mudlle>' prompt.

To compile a file:
  fcompile("<filename.mud>")
This produces <filename.obj>.

To load a compiled file:
  fload("<filename.obj>");

Remember, the source code is the documentation.
